They knew there were inefficiencies but couldn't pinpoint them in their scattered data.\n\nOur Data Health Check connected their procurement, production, and waste management systems. We deployed a unified data model to track material flow from entry to exit.\n\nWe identified a consistent material leakage issue in one of their production lines, amounting to nearly $AUD 600,000 in annual losses. We built a simple, real-time dashboard to monitor this variance, allowing them to fix the process and prevent future losses.",

It automated all their standard reports—P&L, cash flow, and departmental budgets—into a single, interactive dashboard.\n\nThis reduced their monthly reporting time by 90% and completely eliminated manual data entry errors, freeing the team to focus on strategic financial analysis instead of data wrangling.",
